We have a small and socially distant audience and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic among other things. Everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm only twice at the end of the debate. And now when I introduce the candidates, please welcome, California, Senator Kamala Harris and vice president Mike Pence. "
"Speaker 2","0:58","0:58","0.19999999999999574","Thank."
"Speaker 1","0:58","3:18","139.6","You. Senator Harris and vice president Pence. Thank you for being here. We're meeting as President Trump and the first lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for covid-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the Coronavirus. The two campaigns in the commission on presidential debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching One Note no one in either campaign or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics all raise our what questions I'll ask this 90-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about ten minutes each. I'll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you. Sometimes the same question. Sometimes a different question on the same topic you will then have two minutes to answer without interruption by me or the other candidate then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue at that point. Although there will always be more to say we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is Lively. But Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control over the past week Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more covid cases over the past seven days than in the week before nine states have set new records, even if a vaccine is released soon. The next Administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden Administration due in January and February that a trump Administration wouldn't do would you impose new lockdowns for? Businesses in schools and hot spots a federal mandate to wear Mass. You have two minutes to respond without interruption. "
"Speaker 2","3:18","4:25","67.1","Thank you Susan. Well the American people have witnessed. What is the greatest failure of any presidential Administration in history of our country? And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country and just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease one in five businesses closed. We're looking at Frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people. So in the last several months had to file for unemployment and here's the thing on January 28th. The vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal and consequence that it is Airborne that it will affect young people. And that it would be contracted because it is Airborne. And they knew what was happening and they didn't."
"Speaker 3","4:25","4:26","1.0","Tell you. "
"Speaker 2","4:26","5:25","58.599999999999966","Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th as opposed to March 13th, but they knew what you might have done to prepare they knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimize the seriousness of it. The president said you're on one side of his Ledger if you wear a mask you're on the other side of his Ledger if you don't And in spite of all of that today, they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Will Joe Biden does and our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing for testing for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all that is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have knowing that we have to get ahold of what has been going on and we need to save our country and Joe Biden. Is the best leader to do that and frankly this Administration has forfeited. Thank you Ser right to re-election based on this."
"Speaker 1","5:25","5:60","34.80000000000001","Thank you, Senator Harris vice president Pence more than 210,000 Americans have died of covid-19 since February the u.s. Death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy Nation on Earth. For instance. Our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada next door. You had the administration's coronavirus task force. Why is the US death toll as a percentage of our population higher than that of almost every other wealthy country and you have two minutes to respond without interruption. "
"Speaker 3","5:60","8:12","132.7","This isn't thank you. And I want to thank the commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event and Senator Harris. It's privileged to be on the stage with you. In our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day President. Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States all people who had returned from China President. Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. That was he suspended all travel from China the second largest economy in the world. Now Senator Joe Biden Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you having led the White House coronavirus Task Force at that decision. Alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest National mobilization since World War Two and I believe it's saved hundreds of thousands of American lives because with that time we were able to reinvent testing more than a hundred fifteen million tests have been done to date we were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies. So our doctors and nurses had the resources support they needed and we began really before the month of February was Art to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines. Ins and Therapeutics have been saving lives all along the way and under President Trump's leadership operation warp-speed We Believe will have literally tens of millions of doses of vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way and quite frankly when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing creating new PPE developing a vaccine. It looks a little bit like plagiarism which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about I think the American people know that this is a president who has put Bank of America first in the American people. I believe with my heart can be proud of the sacrifices. They have made it saved countless American lives. "
"Speaker 1","8:13","8:15","2.0","Senator Harris. Would you like to respond?"
"Speaker 2","8:15","9:02","46.80000000000001","Absolutely, whatever the vice president is claiming. The Administration has done clearly. It hasn't worked. When you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country American lives that have been lost families that are grieving that loss and you know, the vice president is the head of the task force. And new on January 28th how serious this was and then big thanks to Bob Woodward. We learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed the vice president said when I asked well, why didn't y'all tell anybody he said because the president wanted people to remain calm. Well, let's go I have enough but Susan like this is important and I want to add mr. Vice president speaking."
"Speaker 3","9:02","9:03","1.1000000000000227","I have I'm speaking. "
"Speaker 1","9:04","9:07","3.6000000000000227","Yep, you think more seconds and then we'll give the vice president. So."
"Speaker 2","9:07","9:19","12.0","I want to ask the American people. How come were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How come were you when your kids were sent home from school? And you didn't know when they could go back. How come and do you. "
"Speaker 1","9:20","9:20","0.5","Think when your."
"Speaker 2","9:20","9:24","3.8999999999999773","Children couldn't see your parents? Because you were afraid they could kill them. "
"Speaker 1","9:24","9:28","3.2999999999999545","Miss give vice president Pence a chance to respond vice president. You have one minute."
"Speaker 3","9:28","10:32","64.30000000000007","To respond. Oh, there's not a day gone by that. I haven't thought of every American family that has lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say with the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked. That's a great disservice. The sacrifices the American people have made the reality if I'm if I may finish that the reality is, dr. Fauci said everything that he told the president in the Oval Office the president told the American people now President Trump, I will tell you has boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'd get through this together when you say it has it worked with dr. Fauci and dr. Burks in our medical experts came to us in the second week of March. They said if the president didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That's the reality. Thank you. They also said to us if we did everything right Susan we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans. "
"Speaker 1","10:32","10:33","0.7000000000000455","Vice president One."
"Speaker 3","10:33","10:49","16.399999999999977","Life lost is many Susan but the American people I believed it. Of credit for the sacrifices that they have made putting the health of their family and their neighbors first our doctors our nurses our first thank you vice presidents and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done."
"Speaker 1","10:49","11:14","24.700000000000045","Vice president. Since you were in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, what seems to have been a super spreader event for senior Administration and Congressional officials. No social distancing few mask and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from covid when you at the White House have not been doing so? "
"Speaker 3","11:16","12:09","53.0","Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last 8 months. They've been given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families and their neighbors and people they don't even know first President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and and their ability to take that information and put it into practice in the height of the epidemic when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans had a we surged resources to New Jersey and New York and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people would To be done in the American people made the sacrifices when the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer again American step forward, but the reality is the work of the president of the United States goes on vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy."
"Speaker 1","12:09","12:11","1.6000000000000227","Coneybear. Thank you. Thank you very much. "
"Speaker 3","12:12","12:53","41.5","If I may say that Rose Garden event, then great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there an honor to be there many of the people who were at that events. Susan actually were tested for Coronavirus and it was an outdoor event which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advised the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of Health Care. Thank you Green New Deal all government control. We're about freedom and Respecting the freedom of the American people."
"Speaker 2","12:53","13:47","54.10000000000002","Let's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth, you respect the American people when you have the courage which we be a leader speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves but this Administration stood on information that if you had as a parent if you had as a worker knowing you didn't have enough money saved up and now you're standing in a food line. Because of the ineptitude of a Administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people the American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this Administration. It is asking too much of the people that we talked too much of the people look at they would not be equipped with the information. They need to help themselves to protect their parents."
"Speaker 1","13:47","13:51","3.699999999999932","And their children Kamala Harris. Senator Harris, I mean, I'm sorry."
"Speaker 2","13:51","13:52","1.0","It's fine. I'm coming. No."
"Speaker 1","13:52","14:14","22.600000000000023","No your Senator Harris Tony for life to get back to normal. Dr. Anthony fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be back stated need to be vaccinated but half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump Administration approves a vaccine before or after the election should Americans take it and would you take."
"Speaker 2","14:14","14:28","13.200000000000045","It if the public health professionals if dr. fauci if the doctors tell us that we should take it. I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us I should say that we should take it. I'm not taking it. "
"Speaker 1","14:29","15:25","56.0","Vice president Pence there been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic in recent days. The president's diagnosis of covid-19 has underscored the importance of Job that you hold and that you were seeking that's our second topic tonight. It's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20th. We would be the vice president to the oldest president. The United States has ever had Donald Trump will be 74 years old on inauguration day. Joe Biden will be 78 years old that already has raised concerns among some voters concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice president Pence have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should you have two minutes without interruption? "
"Speaker 3","15:25","17:30","125.30000000000007","Well, Susan thank you. Although I would like to go back to move on but I would like to go back because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine senator in record time in on her. Heard of time in less than a year. We have five companies in Phase 3 clinical trials and we're right now producing tens of millions of doses. So the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump Administration I think is is unconscionable and Senator. I just asked you Stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine We Believe before the end of this year and it will have the capacity to say countless American lives and your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just it's just unacceptable and let me also say you know, the reality is when you talk about about failure in this Administration. We actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009 the swine flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully it was ended up me not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year when Joe Biden was vice president of the United States not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu 60 million Americans contract with the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost two million American lives his own Chief of Staff. Ron. Klain would say last year that it was pure luck that they did quote everything possible wrong and in we learned from that they left the Strategic National stockpile empty. They left an empty and Hollow plan, but we still learn from it and I think American people and I see again can."
"Speaker 1","17:30","17:32","1.2999999999999545","Be priced present tense. I'm sorry."
"Speaker 3","17:32","17:36","4.900000000000091","What we have done and Senator, please. Thank you very much for undermining confidence in a vaccine. "
"Speaker 1","17:37","17:58","21.300000000000182","Senator Harris. Let me ask you the same question that I asked vice president Pence which is have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability. And if not and if you win the election next month, do you think you should you have two minutes uninterrupted? "
"Speaker 2","17:58","20:03","124.79999999999995","Let me tell you first of all the day I got the call from from Joe Biden. It was actually Zoom call asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable memorable days of my life. I you know, I thought about my mother who came to the United States at the age of 19. I'm gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now, I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this, you know, Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work about the value and the Dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the Dignity of all people and I think Joe asked me to serve with him because You know, I have a career that included being elected the first woman district attorney of San Francisco where I created models of innovation for law enforcement in terms of Reform of the Criminal Justice System. I was elected the first woman of color and black woman to be elected Attorney General of the State of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States second only to the United States Department of Justice and there I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations to The big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners to for-profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans and then of course now I serve in the United States Senate is only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate I serve on the Senate intelligence committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in are in war zones and I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share. We share a purpose which is about lifting up the American people and after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump unifying our country around our common values and principles."
"Speaker 1","20:03","20:30","26.899999999999864","Thank you, Senator Harris. You do need that. Neither President Trump nor Vice President. Biden has released a sort of detailed health information that have become the modern Norm until the 2016 election and in recent days President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refuse to answer basic questions about his health and my question to each of you. In turn is is this information voters deserve to know vice president Pence. Would you like to go first? "
"Speaker 3","20:31","21:51","80.0","Well, I'm Susan. Thank you and let me let me say on behalf of the president and the first lady how move we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern and for the president and I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth forever. American impacted by the coronavirus but the care of the president received at Walter Reed hospital White House doctors was exceptional and the transparency that they practiced all along the way we'll continue the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their president and will continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support and sin. I want to thank you and Jill Biden for your Expressions genuine concern and I also want to congratulate you as I did on that phone call on the historic nature of your nomination. I never expected to be on the stage four years ago. So I know the feeling but the reality is we've got an election before the American people in the midst of this challenge a year and the stakes have never been higher. Basically the choice has."
"Speaker 1","21:51","22:06","14.599999999999909","Never been as they want to. Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates and especially about presidents especially when they're facing some kind of challenge."
"Speaker 2","22:06","23:27","81.70000000000005","Absolutely and that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent and certainly by contrast. The president has not both in terms of health records, but also, let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Not paid 750 dollars in taxes when I first heard about it. I literally said you mean 750,000 dollars and it was like no 750 dollars. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for 400 million dollars in just so everyone is clear when we say in debt. It means you owe money to somebody. And it'd be really good to know who the president of the United States the commander-in-chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people of you or self-interest? So Susan I'm glad you asked about transparency because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many many years. The one thing we all know about. Joe he puts it all out there. He he is honest he is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand has been about covering up everything. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","23:27","23:30","3.0","Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond vice president."
"Speaker 3","23:30","24:28","57.59999999999991","Will look I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your Public Service as well. Thank you. The American people have a president was businessman. It's a job creator. Who's paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes payroll taxes property taxes? He's created tens of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate and the president's also released literally stacks of financial disclosures. The American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden 47 years in public service compared to President Donald Trump who brought All of that experience four years ago. Thank you very much. Thank you for trying to this economy around by cutting taxes rolling back regulations. Thank you. Thank you guys for energy fighting for free and fair trade and all of us a nice present. If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, you."
"Speaker 1","24:28","24:30","2.2000000000000455","Know, that's a good segue into our third."
"Speaker 2","24:30","24:31","1.099999999999909","Topic which is."
"Speaker 1","24:31","25:34","62.40000000000009","About the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans. It's been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis Brewing on Friday. We learned that the unemployment rate. Rate had declined to seven point nine percent in September, but the job growth has stalled and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry at Disney and elsewhere hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year. Haven't been replaced those hardest hit include Latinos blacks and women Senator Harris, the Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising four trillion dollars in taxes on Wealthy individuals and corporations some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial Ventures that fuel growth and create jobs would raising taxes, but the recovery at risk and you have two minutes to answer uninterrupted. Thank you. "
"Speaker 2","25:35","27:28","112.5","On the issue of the economy. I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who measures the strength of the Economy based on how rich people are doing which is why he passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America leading to a two trillion dollar deficit that the American people and I have to pay for on day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people and through A plan that is about investing in infrastructure something that Donald Trump said he would do I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened. The Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy Joe was going to invest that money in what we need to do around Innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science And invested in research and development so that we were in an innovation leader on the globe Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example for folks who want to go to a two-year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. You'll go to a public university for free and across the board will make sure that if you have student loan debt, it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the Which is it's about investing in the people of our country as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business. "
"Speaker 1","27:29","27:47","18.299999999999955","Thank you. Dr. Harris vice-president pinch. Your Administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery. But the latest economic reports suggest that's not happening should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months but a year or more you have two minutes to answer. Interrupted. "
"Speaker 3","27:48","29:59","130.60000000000014","When President Trump and I took office America gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression when Joe Biden was vice president, they tried to tax and spend and regulate and bail our way back to a growing economy President Trump cut taxes across the board despite what Senator Harris says the average American family of four had two thousand dollars in Savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred most predominantly for blue collar. Are hardworking Americans the average household income for a family of four increased by four thousand dollars following President Trump's tax cuts. But America you just heard Senator Harris tell you on day one, Joe Biden's going to raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to things right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost twenty two million jobs at the height. We've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes Road. Back regulation Unleashed American Energy fought for free and fair trade and secured four trillion dollars from the Congress of the United States give direct payments to families. Say 50 million jobs through the paycheck Protection Program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people in the American worker through this Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a two trillion dollar Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland and Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect of fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracies on the ballot make no mistake about it season. The American economy the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth. Thank you, sir opportunity for more years of prison at Donald Trump 2021 Vegas economic year in the history of this."

"Speaker 2","30:02","30:15","13.0","Well, I mean, I think that we saw enough of it in last week's debate. But I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth and the truth and the fact is Jill Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year peel."

"Speaker 3","30:20","30:34","14.399999999999864","The important as you said the truth. Joe Biden's V twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single."
"Speaker 1","30:34","30:35","0.900000000000091","Job Senator."
"Speaker 2","30:35","30:38","3.0","That is absolutely not true. That's not only."
"Speaker 3","30:38","30:41","3.0","Cutting is the only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts. "
"Speaker 2","30:41","32:33","111.79999999999995","If you don't mind letting me finish we can then have a conversation. Okay, please okay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than four hundred thousand dollars a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe. Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible. For the Recovery Act that brought America back and now the Trump hence Administration wants to take credit. When they ran when they rode the court coattails of Joe Biden success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course. Now, the economy is of complete disaster. But Joe Biden on the one hand did that on the other hand you have Donald Trump who has reigned over ad recession that is being compared to the Great Depression on the one hand. You have Joe Biden who was responsible with President Barack Obama with the Affordable Care Act, which brought health Over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre-existing conditions and what it also did is it saved to those families who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills, they could not afford on the other hand. You have Donald Trump who's in court right now trying to get rid of thank you for trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections if you have pre-existing conditions, and I just this is very important Susan. Yes, and it's a we need to give we need to give vice president just like that. He interrupted me. I'd like to just finish please. If you have a pre-existing condition heart disease diabetes breast cancer, they're coming for you if you love someone who has a pre-existing condition. Thank you. Thank you so much for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they're coming for you Senator."
"Speaker 1","32:33","32:36","2.5","Harris. Thank you. You're welcome me give you a chance to respond. "
"Speaker 3","32:36","33:43","67.60000000000014","Well, I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have a plan to improve Healthcare and for present protect pre-existing conditions for every American would look Senator Harris you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts. You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said I guarantee I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels they have a two trillion dollar version of the green New Deal Susan that your newspaper USA Today said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal more taxes more regulation Banning fracking abolishing fossil-fuel crushing American Energy and economic surrendered China is a a prescription for economic decline President Trump and I will keep America growing the v-shaped recovery that's underway right now. We'll continue with four more years of President Donald Trump."
"Speaker 1","33:43","34:21","37.69999999999982","Thank you very very much vice president hence. Once again, you've provided the perfect segue to a new topic which is climate change and vice president Pence. I'd like to pose the first question to you this year. We've seen record-setting hurricanes in the South another one hurricane. Delta is now threatening the goal and we have seen Record-setting wildfires in the west. Do you believe as the scientific Community has concluded that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger hotter and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter slower and more damaging. You have two minutes uninterrupted. "
"Speaker 3","34:21","36:42","141.0999999999999","Thank you, Susan. First I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation according to all of the best estimates are our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded or water is among the cleanest in the world and just a little while ago. The president signed the outdoors actually the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in a hundred years. So President Trump has made a commitment to conservation into the environment now with regard to climate change the climate. Is changing the issue is what's the cause and what do we do about it? President? Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris climate Accord. They impose the green New Deal which would crush American Energy would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs and President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know, what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries. They're still in the Paris climate Accord, but we've done it through Innovation and we've done it through natural gas and fracking which Senator the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says, otherwise now as You do but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking and so by creating the kind of American innovation. We're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment with regard to wildfires President Trump and I believe that Forest management has to be front and center and even Governor Gavin Newsom from your state as agreed. We've got to work on Forest management and with regard to hurricanes the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually Ali is different as they are there are no more hurricanes today than there were a hundred years ago. Thank you, but many of the climate alarmists use very canes and wild Flyers to try and sell the goods of a green New Deal and President Trump and I are going to always put American jobs and American workers first. "
"Speaker 1","36:43","37:08","25.09999999999991","Senator Harris as the vice president mentioned who co-sponsored the green New Deal and Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the green, New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website, it describes the green new deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the green New Deal. You have two minutes uninterrupted. "
"Speaker 2","37:08","39:22","133.9000000000001","Or so. First of all, I will repeat and the American people now that Joe Biden will not ban fracking that is a fact that is a fact I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than four hundred thousand dollars a year, Joe Biden's economic plan Moody's which is a reputable Wall Street firm has said will create seven million more jobs than Donald Trump's and part of those jobs that will be created by Joe Biden are going to be about clean energy. And renewable energy because you see Joe understands that the west coast of our country is burning including my home state of California Josie's what is happening on the Gulf States which are being battered by storms Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods and so Joe believes again in science. I'll tell you something Susan I served when I first got to the Senate on the committee. That's Responsible for the environment. Do you know this Administration took the word science off the website and then took the phrase climate change off the website this we have seen a pattern with this Administration, which is they don't believe in science and Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it. But we're also going to create jobs Donald Trump when asked about the wildfires in California, and the question was, you know, the science is telling us is you know, what Donald Trump said science doesn't know. So let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us. As human beings Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy with going to be about the creation of millions of jobs. We will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 carbon neutral by 2035 Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump Administration and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. Third we will also re-enter the climate agreement with pride. "
"Speaker 1","39:22","39:31","8.5","Senator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat vice president Pence. Do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat? "
"Speaker 3","39:33","40:56","82.89999999999964","I said Susan climate is changing will follow the science. But once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week and on day one. He was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered two thousand dollars in tax relief to the average family of four Across America with regard to Banning for Gagging I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking you were the first Senate co-sponsor of the green New Deal and while Joe Biden denied the green New Deal Susan, thank you for pointing out. The green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA Today said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted an in the Senate and you just heard the senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris climate Accord look, The American people have always cherished our environment will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don't need a massive two trillion dollar Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families. Thank you. Joe Biden wants us to retrofit."
"Speaker 1","40:56","40:57","1.0","4 million. "
"Speaker 3","40:58","41:09","11.300000000000182","Business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost. Rob's President Trump. Thank you for America First he's going to put Jobs first and we're going to take care of our environment and follow the science."
"Speaker 2","41:09","42:37","88.0","They've been on Senator here. Let's talk about that you the vice president earlier referred to as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment. The the president's trade war with China. You lost that trade War you lost it what ended up happening is because of a so-called trade war with China. America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession because of it and when we look at where this Administration has been there are estimates that by the end of the term of this Administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential Administration and the American people know what I'm talking about. You know, I think about 20 year olds. As you know, we have a 20 year-old 20-something Ural who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering is there going to be a job there for me? We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of Leadership of this Administration. "
"Speaker 1","42:37","42:42","5.199999999999818","Thank you, Senator Harris vice president pants. Let me give just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on."
"Speaker 3","42:42","43:32","49.59999999999991","To well, I love to respond. Look lost the trade war with China. Joe Biden never fought it Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China through over the last several decades. And again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion. You're not entitled to your own facts. We Joe Biden is Vice President. We lost two hundred thousand manufacturing jobs. And President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back in our first three years after we cut taxes roll back regulations Unleashed American Energy this Administration saw 500,000 next jobs created and that's exactly the kind of growth. We're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through. Thank you very much pandemic Green New Deal you guys massive him and ate your Paris climate Accord. It's going to kill jobs this time. Just like it killed jobs. "
"Speaker 2","43:32","43:33","1.099999999999909","When I just need to respond. "
"Speaker 1","43:35","43:35","0.1999999999998181","Thank."
"Speaker 2","43:35","43:46","11.099999999999909","You. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's Auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank."
"Speaker 1","43:46","44:21","34.59999999999991","You. I'd like to talk about China we have as our next topic. We have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American Agricultural Goods. It's a potential partner in dealing with climate change in North Korea and in a video tonight President Trump. And blamed it for the coronavirus saying China will pay vice president Pence. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China competitors adversaries enemies? You have two minutes. "
"Speaker 3","44:21","44:60","38.70000000000027","Thank you, Susan. Well, let me before I leave that let me let me speak to voting records if I can, you know, everybody knows that NAFTA cost literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go South of the Border President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA and the United States Mexico. Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only ten members of the Senate to vote against the USMC a it was a huge win for American Auto Workers. He was a huge win for American farmers, especially dare."
