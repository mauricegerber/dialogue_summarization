The first US-Russia summit of the Biden presidency will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June.
That comes at the tail end of Biden's already scheduled trip to the United Kingdom for the G7 summit and Brussels for a meeting of Nato leaders, giving the president plenty of time to hear from US allies before sitting down with Putin.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, in a statement announcing the meeting, said the summit would cover a full range of pressing issues as the US seeks to restore predictability and stability to its Russian relations.
That echoes comments Secretary of State Antony Blinken made during a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Iceland last week, as he said Biden's goal was a predictable, stable relationship with Russia.
